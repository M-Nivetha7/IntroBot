## 🌟 About the Project

**SimTrack Bot** is a simple mobile robot simulation developed using **Webots**.  
This project focuses on understanding how robots are modeled, placed in a simulated world, and prepared for future tasks like movement and tracking.

This project marks my first hands on experience with Webots and robot simulation.

Through this project, I explored:
- Webots interface and world setup
- Scene Tree and node hierarchy
- Creating a robot environment from scratch
- Understanding Solid, Shape, and geometry
- Basics of robot simulation concepts
